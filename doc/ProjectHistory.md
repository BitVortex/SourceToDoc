# Project History

SourceToDoc originated in an academic context and was used to explore automated extraction of documentation and design signals from existing codebases.

Today, the repository is structured and maintained as a general-purpose, automation-focused toolchain. The documentation is written primarily for users who want a practical workflow (setup, run, inspect outputs), and links to deeper background material where it helps.
